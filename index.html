            <p>
            For too long Luigi has come in second place. All anyone talks about is Mario! Every game Mario is in has his name in it. You give Luigi a mansion, but it's haunted by ghosts that he has to deal with all of them. If you have found your way onto this website then you have had enough! You want Luigi to get the credit he deserves. <br> <br> If you want to know more about Luigi you can <a href="">click here</a> and if you want to learn about all the games Luigi has appeared in <a href="">this is where you go</a>. Enough is enough let us give Luigi the praise he so rightly deserves!
